This month at the NSManchester iOS developer group we ran a Swift hack session because for many iOS developers it can be difficult to find the time to pick up Swift outside of business hours during which time Objective-C is the predominantly used language. 

The hack involved adding new functionality to the NSManchester app which was created primarily as a learning exercise allowing the community to try out new things as well as to get feedback from and exchange knowledge with peers. Making the app iOS 9 only allows the community to experiment with APIs only available in iOS 9 onwards e.g. [UIStackView](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIStackView_Class_Reference/) which frequently can't be used during business hours owing to the need to support previous versions of iOS.

The source code for the app is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/NSManchester/nsmanchester-app) and all are welcome to contribute new features whilst learning Swift. To get started, just [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and when done, [raise a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to request the feature be merged into the main codebase. Raising a pull request will automatically cause [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) to build the codebase so that you can determine whether the code to be merged will cause issues for other developers. To keep things running smoothly, only pull requests which build successfully will be merged. The up-to-date build status of the app can be viewed [here](https://travis-ci.org/NSManchester/nsmanchester-app). Happy hacking with Swift!

[NSManchester](https://madlab.org.uk/events/ns-manchester-apr-2016/) takes places at 7pm on the first Monday of each month at [Madlab](https://madlab.org.uk/) in the Northern Quarter, Manchester. To keep up-to-date with the latest news, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nsmanchester).
